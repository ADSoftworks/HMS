How to configure this application:

Open your database manager and run the db_seed.sql file
to plant the database structure necessary for the application
to properly store and retrieve data.

Next up open the index.php file and scroll to the configuration section.
(It's supposed to be somewhere at the top)

* ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD:

Change the ADMIN_PASSWORD to a password for your administrator.
You can log in with it at index.php/admin or index.php/adminlogin.
Don't forget to logout when you're done.

* MASTER EMAIL:

Change the MASTER_EMAIL to an email address that the application
can send emails from as an alias.
The email address does not have to be real or exist.
It's just an alias for the application to use so your users know where it's from.

* TITLE:

This is the title of your application.
It should be pretty self-explanatory.

* WEBSITE URL:

The application -needs- to know where it is.
Please supply the URL where the website is situated.
For instance: http://www.huiswerkmanagementsysteem.nl/

* DATABASE SETTINGS:

Please set USERNAME to the username of the database account
and PASSWORD to the password of that database account.

Make sure that DATABASE is set to "homework", do not change this.

HOSTNAME shouldn't have to be changed unless your database is not on localhost.


If you've set all the configurations and execute the Database seed;
the application should now be running accordingly.
